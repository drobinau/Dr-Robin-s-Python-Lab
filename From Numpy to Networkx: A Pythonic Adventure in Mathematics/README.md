In this third and final installment of Dr. Robin Wang's Python and Mathematics trilogy, From NumPy to NetworkX: A Pythonic Adventure in Mathematics explores advanced topics that bridge high school and university-level mathematics.

This book is your ticket to discovering the fascinating interplay between mathematics and programming. From the foundations of matrix manipulation with NumPy to the intricate structures of graphs and networks with NetworkX, each chapter is crafted to challenge, inspire, and deepen your understanding of both fields.

What You'll Discover:

Master matrices and linear algebra with Python's NumPy library.

Visualise data and functions like a pro using Matplotlib.

Uncover the beauty of linear transformations and conic sections.

Analyse statistical data with clarity and precision.

Explore calculus concepts with Python-powered insights.

Solve real-world optimisation problems through programming.

Navigate the world of graphs and networks using NetworkX.

This book follows A Not Too Short Introduction to Python and When Maths Meets Python: 100 Coding Experiments for Problem Solvers, tying together foundational programming knowledge and practical problem solving strategies. Ideal for students, educators, and lifelong learners, this book brings advanced mathematics to life through interactive code examples and real world applications.
