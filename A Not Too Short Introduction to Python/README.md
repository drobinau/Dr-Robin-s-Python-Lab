Unlock the power of Python programming. 

Whether you are a high school student curious about coding or an adult wanting to learn programming for the first time, "A Not Too Short Introduction to Python" offers a complete and accessible introduction to Python. Written by Robin Wang (Dr. Robin), an experienced teacher and coding expert, this book bridges the gap between Python's beginner-friendly syntax and more advanced programming concepts. 

What's inside:

Clear and simple explanations: This book is designed for readers who are new to Python or programming in general. Complex topics are broken down into easy-to-understand sections, supported by real-life examples and coding challenges.

Practical coding skills: You'll learn Python basics such as data types, functions and control structures before moving on to more advanced concepts like recursion, object-oriented programming (OOP), functional programming and list comprehensions.

Hands-on examples: Every section includes hands-on examples to demonstrate how Python can be applied to solve mathematics problems, automate tasks, and create dynamic programs.

Interactive programming with Turtle: the book introduces the Turtle graphics module, allowing you to visualise code in action through creative drawing projects. This section is especially engaging for younger learners and helps develop coding intuition in a fun way.
